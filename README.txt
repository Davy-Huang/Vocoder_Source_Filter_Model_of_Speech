This digital vocoder is written through MATLAB and based on Source Filter Model of speech. 
	It is designed to record and playback speech with varying parameters.
	In the Source Filter Model, speech is modeled as an output of a time varying filter and source signal
Sampling
	Recorded speech is deconstructed into a fundamental frequency, pitch vector and envelope matrix.
Resynthesize
	From the sampled signal, changes can be made to the pitch vector alter the resynthesizes. These parameters include:
	-Male/Female
	 -Monotone
	-Whispered
	-Pitchless
